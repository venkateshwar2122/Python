# How Bubble Sort Works:-
1. Compare adjacent elements: If the left element is greater than the right, swap them.
2. Continue comparing and swapping until the largest element moves to the end.

  j and j+1 pointer se hum largest element ko catch kar rahe hai and uss largest element
  ko last index tak le jaakar vahan rakh de rahe hai.

________________________________________________________________________________________
  
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
for i in range(len(l)-1):
    for j in range(len(l)-1-i):
        if l[j] > l[j+1]:
            l[j], l[j+1] = l[j+1], l[j]
print(l)


I/P:
8 12 3 5 9 7 14
O/P:
[3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14]

QUE:

for i in range(len(l)-1):
    for j in range(len(l)-1-i):
        if l[j] > l[j+1]:
            l[j], l[j+1] = l[j+1], l[j]
print(l) 

IN ABIOVE CODE , after a point the inner loop will not work then how outer loop will work ???

Excellent question! You're thinking like a real programmer — observing that after a certain point, the inner loop doesn’t do any swaps and wondering why the outer loop still runs.

Let’s break it down clearly.

🔁 Code You Mentioned
python
Copy
Edit
for i in range(len(l)-1):                 # Outer loop
    for j in range(len(l)-1-i):           # Inner loop
        if l[j] > l[j+1]:
            l[j], l[j+1] = l[j+1], l[j]   # Swap if needed
print(l)
This is the basic Bubble Sort.

🔧 Key Observation:
After a few passes:

If the list becomes sorted early,

The inner loop does no swaps, but the outer loop still runs because there's no condition to stop it.

🤔 So your question is:
If the inner loop has nothing left to do, why does the outer loop still run?

Answer:
Because the outer loop is a for loop — it doesn’t care about whether the inner loop did anything. It just runs its full range.

✅ How to Fix That? Add a "No Swaps" Optimization!
You can add a flag to check whether the inner loop made any swaps:

python
Copy
Edit
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
n = len(l)

for i in range(n - 1):
    swapped = False  # 🔁 Reset flag for each outer loop
    for j in range(n - 1 - i):
        if l[j] > l[j + 1]:
            l[j], l[j + 1] = l[j + 1], l[j]
            swapped = True  # ✅ A swap occurred
    if not swapped:
        break  # 🛑 No swaps → list is already sorted

print(l)
🚀 Example:
Input:

Copy
Edit
1 2 3 4
First pass: no swaps → swapped = False

So the outer loop breaks early and doesn't waste time.

💡 Why Is This Important?
Without the swapped flag:

You do up to n-1 passes no matter what.

With the flag:

You exit early if the list is already sorted.

This improves the performance on nearly sorted lists to O(n).
