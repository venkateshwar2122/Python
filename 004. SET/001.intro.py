SET is colection of elements

Properties of Sets:-
No Duplicates → Duplicate values are automatically removed.
Unordered →     Elements do not have a fixed position means doesn't maintain inserion order thus it doesn't support indexing
Mutable (set is mutable) → You can add or remove elements.
Cannot Contain Mutable Data Types(set elements are not immutable) → Lists & dictionaries cannot be set elements, but tuples can.

NOTE: List, set,dictionary are mutable but tuple is immutable
