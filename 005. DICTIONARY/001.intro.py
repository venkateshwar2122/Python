1. Dictionary is collection of key-value pair.

2. In Python, dictionary keys must be unique and hashable. This means the key must be of an immutable data type. Some common 
immutable data types that can be used as dictionary keys are:
Strings (str)
Numbers (int, float, complex)
Tuples (only if all the elements inside the tuple are immutable)
Booleans (True, False)


3.  dictionaries in Python are mutable! ðŸŽ¯ This means you can add, remove, or modify key-value pairs after the dictionary is created.
